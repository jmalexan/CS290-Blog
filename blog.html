        <h2>Thoughts on Assignment 3</h2>
        <h3>11/5/2018</h3>
        <hr/>
        <h4>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did I have.  How did I solve those problems?</h4>
        <p>The most challenging for me was figuring out the click even registration.  Historically, I've always used the onclick attribute for button tags, and so in this assignment since I couldn't modify the html I had to figure out how to register events through JS alone.  Luckily this was covered in lecture, and everything else pretty much just fell into place.</p>
        <h4>What did I learn from this assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?</h4>
        <p>Aside from the way to register events through JS, I learned a lot about manipulating nodes using JS.  Specifically, how variables storing Nodes function as pointers to the specific node in the DOM, and if the node is moved the variable will stay pointing to that same node.  You can break this with a clone function, but even still that new cloned element only exists as a single instance, and if you try and put it multiple places in the DOM it will be moved around, rather than duplicated.</p>
        <h4>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did I use each of these resources?</h4>
        <p>Again, the most helpful resources for me in figuring out this assignment was Google, StackOverflow, and the Mozilla Developer Network.  In addition though, with this assignment, there were a couple concepts that were central to this assignment like the JS event registration that I learned in lecture, which was pretty nice because I've mostly already known the content covered in lecture.  Learning a new concept through the lecture felt good.</p>
        <h4>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h4>
        <p>I had to google how to remove elements from the DOM, as well as how to clone nodes for use elsewhere in the DOM.  This came in useful for adding new sales posts to the site, as well as saving the original set of posts so I could accomplish the extra credit goals.</p>

        <h2>Thoughts on Assignment 2</h2>
        <h3>10/14/2018</h3>
        <hr/>
        <h4>What was challenging about the assignment, and what specific kinds of problems did I have.  How did I solve those problems?</h4>
        <p>The most challenging thing about this assignment was trying to match the style as close as I possibly could.  There were a lot of layout and style specifics that I wanted to try and get just right, even though I had no access to the real source code of the site.  In the end, I created a way to switch between the live site and the picture of the goal site really quickly, so I could essentially use that to identify where exactly I was off, and try and fix it as well as I could.</p>
        <h4>What did I learn from this assignment?  Were there any special insights you had?  What did you find that you already knew?</h4>
        <p>The biggest thing I learned from this assignment was CSS layout.  Most of the websites I've made already have been pretty simplistic in layout, and this is the first one that features a grid of objects, with a panel on the left, that all dynamically fit in the screen.  I had already known about the flex style layout, but being able to use it and practice it really taught me how to use it, and I have a lot better understanding of it now than I did before.</p>
        <h4>What kinds of resources were helpful for completing the assignment? Specific websites? Lectures? The class Piazza forum? The TAs? How did I use each of these resources?</h4>
        <p>The resources I used the most were stackoverflow and MDN.  MDN I used to look up specific properties to see how they worked, and the values I could use in those properties.  Stack Overflow I used to get guidance on how to accomplish some of the things I wanted to do, on a broad level rather than a specific property level.</p>
        <h4>What are one or two things you had to Google to complete the assignment?</h4>
        <p>The thing that I spent the most time googling was "how to put two divs next to eachother".  The hardest part about finding the right answer to this is that there's multiple ways to accomplish this, each with their own quirks that affect the end result, and it took a little bit of googling to find the result I needed in the end.</p>

        <h2>Thoughts on Assignment 1</h2>
        <h3>9/24/2018</h3>
        <hr/>
        <h4>What did I struggle with?</h4>
        <p>My biggest struggle with this assignment was designing a site that I felt looked good, without using CSS at all.  This served as an interesting challenge to overcome, and I mostly just spent my time making sure the spacing and text sizes were as good as I could make them.  In addition, I struggled with the content itself.  I've always struggled with finding "and interesting fact/story" to talk about, and it took me a while to think about a topic to write about.</p>
        <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
        <p>I mostly knew everything I needed to when I worked on this assignment.  This included basic HTML structure and text tags, as well as the img tag and how that works.</p>
        <h4>What resources were most helpful?</h4>
        <p>I didn't really use any resources in completing this assignment, just prior knowledge.</p>
