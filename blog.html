        <h2>Thoughts on Assignment 1</h2>

        <h4>What did I struggle with?</h4>
        <p>My biggest struggle with this assignment was designing a site that I felt looked good, without using CSS at all.  This served as an interesting challenge to overcome, and I mostly just spent my time making sure the spacing and text sizes were as good as I could make them.  In addition, I struggled with the content itself.  I've always struggled with finding "and interesting fact/story" to talk about, and it took me a while to think about a topic to write about.</p>
        <h4>What did I learn?</h4>
        <p>I mostly knew everything I needed to when I worked on this assignment.  This included basic HTML structure and text tags, as well as the img tag and how that works.</p>
        <h4>What resources were most helpful?</h4>
        <p>I didn't really use any resources in completing this assignment, just prior knowledge.</p>
